# Challenge 1:

# # Given a list of names, write a Python program that groups the names that have the same set of characters and returns the grouped names in a list of lists.

# # names = [['PRAMIT'], ['SHUBHAM'], ['SWETHA'], ['ROLSTAN'], ['PRADEEP'], ['ROBIN']]

# # Output: [["PRADEEP", "PRAMIT"], ["ROBIN", "ROLSTAN"], ["SHUBHAM", "SWETHA"]]

# your code goes here

# Challenge 2:

# # data = [1,[12,'a'],['b','c',4],[5,'d','d'],[50,5]]

# # Output: {"a": 50, "b": 12, "c": 5, "d": 4}

# your code goes here

# Challenge 3:

# # Finding all the Pythagorean triplets within a given range of numbers. (1, 10)

# # A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three positive integers, a, b and c, that satisfies the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

# # output: 3 4 5
#           6 8 10

# your code goes here

# Challenge 4:

# Write a program using nested loops to draw this pattern.

# User will enter the number of rows.

# For, given input 6. The output will be:

# &&
# & &
# &  &
# &   &
# &    &
# &     &

# For, given input 10. The output will be:

# &&
# & &
# &  &
# &   &
# &    &
# &     &
# &      &
